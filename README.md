# kobe-every-shot-ever
The code behind http://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/

This graphic uses data from stats.nba.com to plot all the shots Kobe Bryant ever took during NBA games (except two shots that are mysteriously missing). It uses Pandas, Matplotlib, CartoDB and Leaflet to scrape and display the data.

The Python code is in a Jupyter notebook in this repository. You can view it here on Github or run it yourself if you have Jupyter installed. To install all the necessary libraries:
	
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
